# LeaveHelper

LeaveHelper is a command line app written in Java that allows you to keep a record of your annual leave bookings. It is my first Github repo for a Java project. I produced it as part of a Java training course and it took me 1.5 days. I need to refactor and improve it but I was keen to publish and share my initial creation. I also intend to add a new feature or two.

The app is based on an annual leave allocation (# days) which applies for a calendar year only i.e. you are constrained to making leave bookings within the year. You set your allocation at the beginning. You can make bookings as long as you have enough days of annual leave remaining.
